# Image Analysis Readme file

pbKinetics.py == This script mainly identifies peaks in time trace files and generates appropriate peak and frame information. It can be executed through multiple parameters - 
	(a) STARTER: The second argument is the dateStamp. Identifies the first tif file in time traces and uses Alexander's algorithm (pflibMP.py) to identify all the peaks. 
	Generates a pkl file which contains all the peak Information.
	(b) ANALYSE: Must pass a pkl file as the second argument. This analyses the information (like signal intensity) for all the identified peaks through the rest of the frames. 
	Generates two shelve files. (i) peak_frameInfo.shelve (information of a peak through the frames (default=600 frames) and (ii) frame_peakInfo.shelve (aggregated info of peaks in each frame)
	(c) GENERATE: Second argument is dateStamp. Identifies all the pkl file (from STARTER) and makes a bash script (in a bashDir) for executing ANALYSE parameter with each pkl file

pbAnalyse.py == This script mainly analyses the shelve files generated by pbKinetics to make graphs and csv file for further analysis.
